# Bar-Code-Detection-and-Decoding
This project aims to use image processing techniques to analyze images and extract information, such as detecting barcodes and identifying the largest rectangular contour in an image. To implement these tasks, libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, matplotlib, and pyzbar were used.
